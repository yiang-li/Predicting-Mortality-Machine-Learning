LR: 
Feature importance:
The most important feature in predicting mortality is age. As age increases, the predicted probability of being deceased decreases. This appears counterintuitive in the context of the general population. However, WLS is a survey sample of high school graduates that have mostly homogeneous ages, with very few individuals age pretty old. This is maybe because they returned to high school after work and their disposition status might have biased the results. Further, with limited variations in age, being older might indicate something other than chronological age: they entered school later, started work later and maybe under heavier peer pressure when being compared to their peers of the same age (who may graduate from school sooner than they do). All other variables appear consistent with the sociological findings that higher self-rated health and household assets are protective factors of mortality while being male and smoking are risk factors for mortality.

Wrong cases:
    False positive: Lower importance is given to social participation measures as opposed to demographic measures on income, race, education, and marital status. This is consistent with the findings that social participation is not a strong predictor of mortality. However, the model does not capture the fact that social participation is a protective factor for mortality. This is because the model is not able to capture the interaction between social participation and other variables. For example, social participation is a protective factor for mortality for those who are married, but not for those who are single. The model does not capture this interaction. Hence, for someone with high risk in terms of demographic measures, the model does not capture the protective effect of social participation. Hence, when predicting them as dead following demographic measures, the model is wrong. This is the case for the false positive cases.
    False negative: The model does not capture the interaction between social participation and other variables. For example, social participation is a protective factor for mortality for those who are married, but not for those who are single. The model does not capture this interaction. Hence, for someone with high risk in terms of demographic measures, the model does not capture the protective effect of social participation. Hence, when predicting them as alive following demographic measures, the model is wrong. This is the case for the false negative cases.
SVM: 
Feature importance:
The coefficients are largely consistent with the LR. Though age is still the most important feature, its important is not that different from all otehr features. This might because of different ways of estimation of the coefficients. The SVM model is more robust to outliers and the coefficients are more stable. Other findings are consistent with academic literature on public health and the ranking/coefficients of the features are consistent with the LR model.

Wrong cases:
    Generally, the wrong cases are consistent with the LR model. The false positive cases are those with high risk in terms of demographic measures, but low risk in terms of social participation measures. The false negative cases are those with low risk in terms of demographic measures, but high risk in terms of social participation measures.
    However, the difference might arise from the fact that the SVM model is more robust to outliers and the coefficients are more stable (with lower influence of demographic variables relative to social participation variables). This might explain why the false positive cases are less likely to be predicted as alive by the SVM model. The false negative cases are more less to be predicted as dead by the SVM model.

Fuzzy SVM:
Feature importance: It is not clear how to interpret the feature importance of the fuzzy SVM model as the coefficients are not available.

Wrong cases:
    The wrong cases are generally consistent with the LR model, indicating that the important features are overall similar. However, fuzzy SVM seems to consider drink alcohol as an important feature as the wrong cases drink alcohol are more likely to be predicted as dead by the fuzzy SVM model. This may have caused mistakes as there are more important risk factors of mortality among the features. By contrast, there is low important applied to demographic features such as race and gender, that may have caused errors as well.
